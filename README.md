# OpenCV.Net

OpenCV.Net is a reimplementation of [Emgu CV](https://github.com/emgucv/emgucv), a cross-platform .Net wrapper to the OpenCV image processing library.

OpenCV.Net reimplements the methods of the Emgu CV library, but conforms them to the [OpenCV API Reference](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/refman.html) 
style so that they can be more easily used with the python/C documentation and examples.

Most notably this means adding return types and optional parameters.
